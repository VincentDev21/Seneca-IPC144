1. Given the following C statements:
double price1 = 10.10, price2 = 10.12, price3 = 10.15; 
int cents1 = (int)(price1 * 100); 
int cents2 = (int)(price2 * 100); 
int cents3 = (int)(price3 * 100); 
printf("%d 10.10 = %.15lf\n", cents1, price1); 
printf("%d 10.12 = %.15lf\n", cents2, price2); 
printf("%d 10.15 = %.15lf\n", cents3, price3);
Briefly explain why the cents2 variable doesn't properly represent the total cents of price2.

This can be caused due to the binary number not accurately representing the decimal number. Floating point numbers are represented similary to a scientific notation which includes a exponent and mantissa.
During the calculation there may be an error when converting the binary number to the decimal number which leads in loss of precision.

int main()
{
    int subtotal;
    
    printf("Enter amount= ");
    scanf("%d", &subtotal);
    
    int $50,$20,$10,$5;
    
    $50= subtotal/50;
    $20= (subtotal-50*$50)/20;
    $10=(subtotal-50* $50-20*$20)/10;
    $5=(subtotal-50* $50-20*$20-10*$10)/5;
    printf("$50= %d\n" "$20= %d\n" "$10= %d\n" "$5= %d", $50, $20, $10, $5);
    return 0;
}

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int total;
    printf("Enter total amount of money: ");
    scanf("%d", &total);
    printf("%.2lf", (double)total/100);
    printf("\n%.2f\n", (float)total/100);
    printf("%.2Lf",(long double)total/100);
    return 0;
}
