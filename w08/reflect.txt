1. The Structure would need atleast need 60 bytes since the structure has 6 
double and 3 interger variables. 1 interger variable equals to 4 bytes and 
1 double variable equals 8 bytes. There for since there are 6 double and 3 
interger varaibles if we do basic math. (6*8)+ (3*4)=60. In order to improve
the passing of information through functions we can pass a structure array 
into the function. Within my program when displaying the ReportData I passed
struct I set a array with type "struct Reportdata" and passed the array through
the function and set the parameter of the function to recieve the ReportData structure.

2.
struct CatFoodInfo {
    int sku;
    double price;
    int calories;
    double weight;
};
struct ReportData {
    int sku;
    double price;
    int calories;
    double weight_lbs;
    double weight_kg;
    int weight_g;
    double servings;
    double cost_per;
    double cost_cal;
};
The structures above is what I have currently in my program. Since the first 4 variables in ReportData
are similar to CatFoodInfo. We can replace the first 4 variables by calling in the structure CatFoodInfo.
struct CatFoodInfo {
    int sku;
    double price;
    int calories;
    double weight;
};
struct ReportData {
    double weight_kg;
    int weight_g;
    double servings;
    double cost_per;
    double cost_cal;
    struct CatFoodInfo data;
};
This is the improved version of the structure ReportData. All I did was deleting the first 4 varaibles and 
calling the CatFoodInfo and initializing a variable with the structure.
In order to print the structure variables we need to add the structure variable for ReportData followed by the structure variable for CatFoodInfo followed by the variable in the structure.
OLD:
printf("\n%07d ....", ReportData.sku, ....
NEW:
printf("\n%07d ....", ReportData.data.sku, ....
