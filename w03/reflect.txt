In this week's workshop, we were tasked to create a program that would prompt the
user with a list of toys with detailed information about each toy. We had to create multiple 
functions that would check the program input that would see if certain products have 
a valid SKU, price, and name and if the product is on sale. I was able to understand
the use of constructors and private and public classes in this week's workshop. 
The use of constructors seemed very helpful since if needed, we can initialize a
variable if needed to any fixed value. I also had a very basic grasp of the use 
of public and private classes. This can be beneficial since being able to lock certain variables
to each class can help prevent logical errors that can occur within the program. Overall this 
workshop didn't seem difficult and it really helped me understand the use of public and private classes.
