1. What you have learned in completing this workshop (do not leave anything out!)

In this workshop I have learned on how to utilize visual studio code to compile simple programs related 
to the workshop I was given. I also learned on how to use the matrix and the SSH client I was using to 
upload, run, and submit my code. Lastly, I learned how to compile a C program which displays text on 
screen.



 
2. Briefly describe what SSH is and how you used it in this workshop 

An SSH or secure shell protocol allows users to intract with the linux server in order to create directories and run programs that has been uploaded onto the linux server.
Users may use a SSH client ex, PuTTy, or command prompt, if on windows, or the terminal, if on mac, to access the SSH. 
During the workshop SSH is used to create directories in order to keep things organized, run the C program that we were required to compile and submit to our instructor.



3. Briefly describe what SFTP is and how you used it in this workshop

An SFTP, also known as secure file transfer protocol, allows users to transfer files through a secure network on to a remote linux server which allows other users to access it if granted permission by the admindestrator.
In order to access the server users are required to use a SFTP client ex.WinSCP, File Zilla, etc to upload or download files using the secure network.
In this workshop SFTP is used to upload a C compiled program in order for the matrix to access and run the program.
