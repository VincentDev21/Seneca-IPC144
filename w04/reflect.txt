1. Selection is important since it allows us user to apply a set a parameters withing the program
to make sure that the user is entering the correct value. This is shown multiple times within my code.
For part 2 I have coded multiple line of code to allow a user to enter a number of apples,oranges,pears
,tomatoes,and cabbage that has to be greater or equal to 0. I also coded mutiple lines of code in which it asks
the user to select different loop types and number of times to iterate that must have an capital letter. I also 
coded a line of code in which a user enter a certian value, that the program would stop.

2. A nested construct allows programmers to loop a statement to verify if its correct or not. The nested construct i have
added in my program was a nested if statement and a nested for statement. the nested if statement allowed the program 
to verify the correct value and the nested for statement allowed the program to pick the right value.

3. My favourite construct is the IF construct sine it is very easy to initialize compared to other constructs and 
the IF construct allows other constructs to work together. in my program I used a while statement nested with the IF 
construct which allows the program to run mutiple times and break the program if needed.
