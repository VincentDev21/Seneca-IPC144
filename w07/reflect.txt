1. Having a structure within your code can make your program more readable and
allow your program to run more efficiently and can make it more stable. Another 
benifit with structures is that when you need to change a value of a variable or 
change the way the variable is declared. It is very easy to find where the variable is located
since its within the structure. This is shown within  my program where I delcared all the variables I need
for the playerinfo and gameinfo within 2 different structures. This allows me to organize the varaiables and know
what variable is used for the playerinfo and gameinfo.
2.In order to keep the history of games played we should delcare a character array that can store the history
and create a for loop that would add the contents of the number of lives, treasure and moves everytime the program runs.
3.I spent most of my time figuring out how to clear the character array everytime the logic runs with out using any ex
that I wasn't taught in class. In order to over come my problem I figured that if I created a for loop that runs a certain 
amount of times that adds '\0' to each section of a array it would clear the array.
