1. What I have done is that I have created a switch statment nested in a if statement 
which allows the switch statment to run when the if statement's conditions are met. 
 
if (year>=MIN_YEAR&& year<=MAX_YEAR &&month>0&&month<=12) { // if statement initialize
            printf("\n*** Log date set! ***\n");

            switch (month) { // switch statement initialize when if statement is true.
            case 1:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-JAN-01", year);
                break;
            case 2:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-FEB-01", year);
                break;
            case 3:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-MAR-01", year);
                break;
            case 4:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-APR-01", year);
                break;
            case 5:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-MAY-01", year);
                break;
            case 6:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-JUN-01", year);
                break;
            case 7:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-JUL-01", year);
                break;
            case 8:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-AUG-01", year);
                break;
            case 9:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-SEP-01", year);
                break;
            case 10:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-OCT-01", year);
                break;
            case 11:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-NOV-01", year);
                break;
            case 12:
                printf("\nLog starting date: %d-DEC-01", year);
                break;
2. The 3 different iterations constructs are while loop,do-while loop, and for loop. 
The loop that I decided to use was a while loop since for this workshop it requires the user 
to enter a correct input that fits within the a certian range. The while loop allows the program
to run constantly until the condtitions are met and would break the program.

3. When I complete the program I usually debug and run the program to find any errors within my code.
For this workshop I mainly encounterd semantic problems I was having some trouble getting the logic
right when initializing the if statement where it would print and break. I have encounterd some syntactic errors
was when nesting the if statements and switch statement with the while loop but I have overcame that by
reading the material that the teacher provided us.
