1. Parallel arrays allowed programmers to store information that are the same 
size as each other. We can use the parallel array to recall back to data that 
we stored and use the data within a different part of the program. 
I have used parral arrays to store the information for each item so that 
I can recall to the information later. I used 4 different parral arrays to 
store the item number, priority, financed and cost of each item. To recall 
back to an item all I needed to do is enter 1 number in each parallel array 
to access all the information I need.

2.Its important since the beginning of an array has an index of 0 therefore 
if we set the  array index with 1 and store the value, when printing each 
value in the array an error may occur since there is no value that is stored 
at the beginning. I have used this in my program when searching for a value 
within a parallel array and by setting the iterator value by 1 it prints out 
a random number instead of the number that i have stored within the parallel.

3.An array is a technique to arrange items in rows and columns. The column 
that are vertical, runs top to bottom, and the rows are horizontal, runs left 
to right. Each column allows each row to have a certain number of empty spaces. 
In a array we must figure out how the right number of columns and rows to store any number of items. 
If there is 10 columns and and we need to store 10 items in a row we have enough columns. 
If we have 10 columns and need to store 2 items we have enough columns since we only need 2 
columns out of the 10 columns that we have. If we have 10 columns and need to store 11 items 
we dont have to enough columns and need to add more columns.
